# Module-6---Vacation-Search

This code pulls hundreds of random cities around the globe from google, and then allows the user to filter them by minimum and maximum temperature. The user can then select the cities they wish to visit and automatically generate routes to them.

Please note that I have combined the search and itinerary functions of this code for continuity. It still functions exactly the same, just out of one file as opposed to two.
